Any cell with a number that is less than the broadcast number will push its number to its neighboring cell on the right. Because the numbers in the stack are always sorted, all the cells that follow a pushed cell will also be pushed because their numbers are also less than the global number. The broadcast number is stored in the left-most pushed cell because that cell is now empty.\n",
